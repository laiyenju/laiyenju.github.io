# AI Alignment Terminology: Whole Brain Emulation

[Whole Brain Emulation], WBE is a proposed technique to transfer the information in a biological brain onto a computer substrate to create a machine intelligence or artificial mind.

The viability depends on having sufficient computing power, brain scanning resolution, and an accurate emulation capturing the relevant neural details. Proposed approaches include slicing and scanning brains, gradually replacing brain areas with computer interfaces, or modeling personalities.

Potential advantages include faster processing, backups, self-modification. But challenges exist around consciousness, personhood, employment impacts if mind copying occurs. The feasibility and timeline are debated, but some analyses suggest WBE may be viable by mid-century.

As a product manager, I was attracted by this roadmap.

And there’s still lot of things to go. I am so curious about how’s the roadmap looks now.
